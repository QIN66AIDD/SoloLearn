You are cheering on your favorite team. After each play, if your team got over 10 yards further down the field, you stand up and give your friend a high five. If they don't move forward by at least a yard you stay quiet and say 'shh', and if they move forward 10 yards or less, you say 'Ra!' for every yard that they moved forward in that play.

Task:
Given the number of yards that your team moved forward, output either 'High Five' (for over 10), 'shh' (for <1), or a string that has a 'Ra!' for every yard that they gained.
